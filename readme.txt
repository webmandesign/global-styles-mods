Fixes styling issues in WordPress 5.9 modifying global styles code.


== Description ==

This plugin fixes styling issues introduced in WordPress 5.9.

= üëç When to use this plugin =

- ‚úÖ Your WordPress is of version 5.9 or newer

- ‚úÖ Your theme does not support [full site editing (FSE) feature](https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/josephine/) (from [conversation about reported issues](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38252) it seems they affect Gutenberg-ready themes only and FSE themes should be fine)

= Technical info =

WordPress 5.9 started applying `!important` rule and is setting up CSS properties (CSS variables) within `body` selector in its global styles code. This rises the global styles specificity and may override styles coming from themes and plugins. (For more info about this change check ["Updates for Settings, Styles, and theme.json" article](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/08/updates-for-settings-styles-and-theme-json/#changes-to-the-global-stylesheet).)

**Global Styles Mods** plugin lowers the specificity of WordPress 5.9 global CSS styles by removing `!important` rules and changing `body` to `:root` selector for setting up WordPress CSS properties (CSS variables).

It also enqueues the global styles early enough so your theme or plugin stylesheet have a better chance to override global styles with minimal effort.

The fix applied is coming from issue [conversation in Gutenberg GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38252#issuecomment-1024348024).
